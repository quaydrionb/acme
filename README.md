## 1. Database Location and Latency Reduction

To minimize latency between the server and the database, we have deployed the database in the same region as the application code. This ensures faster data retrieval and improves overall system responsiveness.

## 2. React Server Components for Server-side Rendering

React Server Components have been utilized for fetching data on the server. This approach allows us to perform expensive data fetches and logic on the server side, reducing the client-side JavaScript bundle size. Additionally, it prevents exposure of database secrets to the client, enhancing security.

## 3. SQL Queries for Efficient Data Retrieval

We have employed SQL queries to fetch only the necessary data from the database. This optimization reduces the amount of data transferred for each request, minimizing both network latency and client-side processing requirements.

## 4. Parallelized Data Fetching with JavaScript

Data fetching has been parallelized using JavaScript where it makes sense to do so. This approach optimizes the retrieval of multiple data sets concurrently, improving overall system efficiency.

## 5. Streaming Implementation

To prevent slow data requests from blocking the entire page and to enable users to interact with the UI without waiting for everything to load, we have implemented streaming. This technique enhances the user experience by allowing partial rendering of content as soon as it becomes available.

## 6. Component-level Data Fetching

Data fetching has been moved down to the components that need it. This isolates the dynamic aspects of routes, making the application more modular and facilitating partial prerendering. Each component independently fetches the necessary data, promoting a more efficient and organized architecture.
